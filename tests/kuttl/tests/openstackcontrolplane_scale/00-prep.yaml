#
# Q: WHAT IS TESTED HERE?
#
# A: 
#
# - Create 6 OpenStackNets and an initially-empty OpenStackControlPlane that only spawns an OpenStackClient
# - Verify that predictable IPs have been assigned to the OpenStackClient (in the OpenStackNet and the
#   associated OpenStackIPSet), and that the OpenStackNets' underlying NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicies have
#   configured successfully
# - Scale the OpenStackControlPlane up to 3 controllers
# - Check for IP reservations in the OpenStackNet, associated OpenStackIPSet and OpenStackVMSet for the 3 
#   VirtualMachines that should be created
# - Check that the OpenStackClient can SSH to all 3 controllers
# - Scale the OpenStackControlPlane down to 1 controller
# - Check that the IP reservations are removed from the OpenStackVMSet and OpenStackIPSet, but remain in the
#   OpenStackNet
# - Scale the OpenStackControlPlane back to 3 controllers
# - Check that the IP reservations in the OpenStackIPSet and OpenStackVMSet reuse the original IPs from
#   the original scale-up
# - Delete the OpenStackControlPlane
# - Check that all sub-resources (OpenStackVMSets, VirtualMachines, OpenStackIPSets, OpenStackClient, etc)
#   are removed
#

#
# Attempt to "clear the field" if necessary
